# ProcrastinatorDebilitator

The Procrastinator Debilitator is an extension that  encourages its users to be able to work without any distraction. 
The user is asked to input websites that serve as a distraction, and it will  block the user from accessing the inputted websites. 
Once the user is done with their work, they can go back to the extension and delete the websites that the user inputted and regain access.
